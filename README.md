* Highly accessible
* Contributors abide by a code of conduct
* Utilizing content/trigger warnings
* Free of advice bordering on (or in fact) victim-blaming, i.e.:
  * “Just don’t pay attention to …”
  * “If you really want … you just have to stop doing …!”
  * “Lean in”
* Written with a focus on helping marginalized individuals
* Written with a focus on intersectional social justice and feminism
* Written without jargon and a goal to continuously improve language
